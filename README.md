## What This Project Does

- Allows users to create an account
- Login securely (passwords are hashed)
- Add tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Store everything locally using text files

The data is saved so tasks remain even after closing the program.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to build something practical instead of just solving small Python problems.  
This project helped me understand:

- How authentication systems work
- How to structure a CLI program
- How to manage versions using Git
- How to push real projects to GitHub

---

## Future Improvements

- Add deadlines and priority levels
- Store data using SQLite instead of text files
- Improve code structure (modular version)
- Build a GUI version
